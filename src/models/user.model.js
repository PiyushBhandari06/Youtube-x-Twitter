// direct encryption isn't possible, that's why we use hooks given by mongoose:
    
//encryption of password:-
    // pre hook -> sets a middleware function that acts just before some events already declared in mongoose like->"save" (or validate,remove,updateOne,deleteOne):-
//userSchema.pre("save",() => {})                  //avoid using arrow fn as callback fn, as arrow fn doesn't have 'this' keyword, it doesn't know context reference.
userSchema.pre("save",async function(next){         //middleware must have the access to its flag(next)
    //encryption process is time consuming, that's why we need async await
    if(this.isModified("password")) {               //only execute when password field is modified,not any other field ! else it will keep encrypting password even when any other field is updated
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password,10)   //it hashes(encryptes) this.password & The 10 is the "salt rounds" â€” also called the cost factor.
    next()      //pass the middleware flag ahead !                                      // Meaning of Salt Rounds: It's the number of times the hashing algorithm runs internally. Higher number = more secure, but slower.

//jwt Tokens
// ðŸ§± Structure of a JWT
//       A JWT looks like this:
//       xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

// It has 3 parts, separated by dots:
// Part	    Name	    Purpose
// xxxxx	Header	    Info about the token & algorithm
// yyyyy	Payload	    The data (user ID, roles, etc.)
// zzzzz	Signature	Verifies the token wasnâ€™t changed

            //only id can be enough, rest you can access during database queries
            //but still if you want you can access as many fields as you want in payload itself..
